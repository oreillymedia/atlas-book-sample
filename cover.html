	<!-- ADD COVER IMAGE FILENAME/LOCATION BELOW:
	<img src="YOUR-FILENAME-HERE.jpg" alt="cover" />-->

	<!-- If you'd like to create your cover via HTML and CSS instead, 
	simply delete the image tag above, and uncomment the div below, 
	adding any HTML you'd like. It's populated with a few sample elements, 
	to help get you started. To style and position your cover elements, 
	edit cover.css in the assets/stylesheets folder. 

	The fallback img tag will ensure that the cover you create here will also 
	appear in your EPUB, MOBI, and HTML formats; please DO NOT modify or 
	delete that element.-->
